# Netflix Clone

Deployment: https://netflix-clone-app-b1ae9.web.app/

This is a netflix clone where you can test user authentication and redux state management in action, use of react-router-dom and creative css styles simulating Youtube's ambient mode. As I always design first, here's a mock up of the app.

Some issues you may find is when the page reloads, the error of no movie is handled but some responses from the API return "undefined" or "null" causing the app to break, in case this happens just reload the app one or two times and it should be back to normal.
