# Netflix With Ambient Mode
Netflix home aesthetic built from the ground up, this project is based mainly in user authentication and state management. This is an awesome showcase of how with a simple UI change netflix can look much better.

Small Bugs to notice: 
- The video Background does not loads sometimes.
- Both Ambient and Video (Background & Banner) do not sync due to load times.
- Expect a delay of at least 20 seconds till the videos start playing, it could be more, but it works.
- Styles missing? Seems .jsx has a weird behavior with styled-components.

## Project Focus
- Authentication
- Error Control
- Loading Screen
- State Management
- Redux Async Chunk
- Styled Components
